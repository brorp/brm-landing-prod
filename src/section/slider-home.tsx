This grain has been awarded "Best Rice in the World" six times by the TRT World Rice Confererence.`,

It provides farmers with direct financial and technical assistance, plus various household benefits.  In return, the farmers collaborate on sustainable agri-practices. BRM's model has been rolled out from its own land to adjacent districts, creating a network that farmers are eager to join.",

Sales channels have been established in Europe, meeting the rigorous standards for EU distribution, and expansion into the US is underway. However, the challenge in the global food-security crisis is creating supply, not meeting demand.",
